# E-Raport
The E-Raport repository is the result of the SIRAM application development. SIRAM is an online learning outcomes report application that is intended for teachers to manage learning outcomes reports for elementary school students, especially in providing grades. SIRAM is built with a simple concept by implementing a ViewModel and fetching data from the API using Retrofit 2. But in the future it will continue to be developed.
